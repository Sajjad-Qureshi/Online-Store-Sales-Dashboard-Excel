## 📁 Project Description:
This project contains 5 months of sales data for an online store. Using Excel, I cleaned the data, added relevant columns for analysis, and built an interactive dashboard that gives a quick summary of the store's performance. This dashboard includes:

- **Total Revenue & Orders**  
- **Top-Earning Product and Best-Selling Product**  
- **Revenue by Category (Pie Chart)**  
- **Monthly Wise Revenue (Bar Chart)**  
- **Slicer to filter by month**  

This is a great example of how Excel can still be a powerful tool for early-stage analytics and storytelling with data.
